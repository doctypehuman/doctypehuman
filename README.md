### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am on my journey from being a Linux enthusiast to being a professional. My repositories are littered with notes that I made while studying. Here are some that might be helpful to you on your journey.

1. [RHCSA 8 Notes](https://github.com/doctypehuman/rhcsa2021)

2. [BASH Scripting](https://github.com/doctypehuman/bash)

3. [SQL Fundamentals](https://github.com/doctypehuman/sql)

Other wise generally in life this is what I am busy with . . .

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on clearing my RHCSA certification.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all things related to Linux.
